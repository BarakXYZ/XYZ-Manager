# XYZ Manager
#### Description:
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 60%;">
<h2> Overview </h2>
XYZ Manager allows you to control multiple windows with keyboard shortcuts.<br>
You can assign different windows to different keys and control them while the app is running in the background.<br>
You can configure the preferences.ini file (that is created when the app is run for the first time) to change the different hotkeys.<br>
The app is built using PySide6 (Qt) and Pynput for keyboard and mouse input.<br>
I plan to keep working on it, but I believe I will take it to C++ for better performance and low-level control.<br>
Thank you for taking a look at my first real project!<br>
P.S - Currently supported on Windows, with some macOS support (not as robust), Linux wasn't tested.<br>
